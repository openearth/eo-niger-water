Reconstructing Niger River Basin surface water dynamics using EO data

Goal: derive surface water area / flow dynamics for Niger River Basin

TODO

- [ ] Automatically generate Niger River topology (river network with all branches) using water occurrence dataset and/or raw satellite data and generate cross-section locations
- [ ] For all cross-sections, derive 15-30 years flow/width relations for multiple locations along the Niger using medium resolution optical satellite images (Landsat 4,5,7,8 and Sentinel-2) 
- [ ] For recent years, derive width changes from Sentinel-1 SAR satellite data (can see during rainy seasons, but only after 2015)
- [ ] For floodplains and wetlands segment into smaller polygons and derive surface water area time series.
